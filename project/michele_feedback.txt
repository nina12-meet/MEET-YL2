I liked your original idea of creating an app where you can add “stickers” to a picture that you want to modify. The idea has a lot of potential, but your app doesn’t quite make it. The first thing I notice when I open the app is that the app is a lot of white space. When I take or upload a picture, I still see a lot of white space - the picture only shows up all the way at the bottom of the page. Making the picture show up in the entire screen will add a lot towards the usability of the app.

There is a tutorial that you read through that you implemented, which was good, but I wanted to see you go further. There are a number of buttons in the interface that don’t do anything, and the large blank space taking up a lot of room in the app decreases the usability of the app.
